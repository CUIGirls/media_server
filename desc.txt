implement tracker that tracks the chunks being downloaded.
multiple users are supposed to share the specified chunk that is being requested -> create a req handler that requsts a chunk from a movie from a user who has it.


our webpage triggers the yts api, the user requests a movie, the req handler is called, the peers will offer chunks, the user will download and merge.
